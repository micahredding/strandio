Your life is sort of like a strand, woven through the world, tied to the people who came before you, the people who will come after you — and wrapped around and around the people you spend your life with. It is made up of memories and experiences, interactions and conversations, sights, smells, tastes, and sounds. And right now, most of it is forgotten.

In early human history, when people rarely survived their thirties, the experiences and wisdom of one generation was gone before the next generation had the chance to learn from it. But as life expectancy increased, something called “the grandmother effect” kicked in. If grandmothers were around as their grandchildren were being raised, they could pass on stories, skills, and insights that would have otherwise been missed. And this in turn would change the children’s sense of themselves and their place in the world.

When writing was invented, the effect intensified. Now it was possible to have a sense of your place in a world that was much bigger, that stretched back into the distant past, and into a distant future. People began to keep genealogies — boring to us now, perhaps, but a way of beginning to map out the conceptual landscape of their world. And with that kind of map, it was possible to start contemplating where you were coming from — and where you were heading to.

People sometimes complain that in the modern world, we are overwhelmed with information, cut off from ourselves, cut off from tradition and history. They fear that information technology is eroding our sense of the past. But the truth is, information technology is what gave us our past in the first place.

A sense of the past enlarges our sense of self, our sense of purpose and meaning and possibility. We need more past, not less; more histories, not fewer.
